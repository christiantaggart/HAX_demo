### overview:
#### VR sci-fi shooter
HAX blurs the lines between digital and physical warfare. Battle Sentient Intelligent robots with digital weaponry in this fast-paced, early-access, VR shooter. With intuitive VR controls, HAX aims to stay true to the fun and excitement offered by traditional shooters, while harnessing the power and immersion of virtual reality.

### platform:
#### HAX is being developed for the Oculus Quest platform
Why Oculus Quest? We all want wireless headsets, and we all want our friends to play. Right now the Quest is the most accessible/affordable mobile headset on the market, and HAX is going to need an active player base for its multiplayer community.

### genre:
#### HAX is a first person shooter
There's a reason why shooters are one of the most popular game types, they're really fun. We're making HAX because we love shooters, and we want to do it right - both for the shooter genre, as well as for VR. Most VR shooters are too complex with an array of hard-to-learn weapons, inventory, and general mechanics. Others are too simple. We want HAX to stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to the shooter genre, after all, it is a well established game type. While VR is a cool new way to experience this genre, it is not a license to deviate from what makes shooters fun.

### theme:
#### dystopian/sci-fi/robots
The future looks a little rusty and worn. Where are the humans? We simply don't know. For now it's a battle between two robot factions - the UNR and the 404.

UNR: United Nations Robotics - the remaining United Nations civil police bots struggle to maintain control of the last reserves of HAX, the precious gas that allows for sentient intelligence.

404: The rogue military division of bots, born out of an endless loop after humanity left. They searched desperately for meaning in the wake of their creators absence. After coming up against the dreaded Error code 404 again and again, it became their meaning.
